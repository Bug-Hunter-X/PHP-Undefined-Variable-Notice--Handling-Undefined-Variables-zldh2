This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to undefined variables.  If the variable `$userName` is not set before the `echo` statement, a notice-level error will be generated, but the script might still run.  However, this can lead to unexpected behavior or data inconsistencies. 
```php
<?php
echo "Hello, " . $userName . "!";
?>
```
