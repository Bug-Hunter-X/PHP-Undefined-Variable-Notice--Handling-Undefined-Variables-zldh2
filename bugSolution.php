This improved code addresses the undefined variable issue by using `isset()` to check if `$userName` is set. If not, it assigns a default value ("Guest") before echoing the greeting. This avoids the notice-level error and provides a more robust solution. 
```php
<?php
if (isset($userName)) {
    echo "Hello, " . $userName . "!";
} else {
    $userName = "Guest";
    echo "Hello, " . $userName . "!";
}
?>
```
